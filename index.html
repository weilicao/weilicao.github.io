            I am a Computer Science PhD student at Duke, co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.shuyanzhou.com/">Shuyan Zhou</a> and Prof. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/">Bhuwan Dhingra</a>. I completed my Master's and Undergraduate degrees at UCSD, where I was fortunate to be advised by 
            <a href="https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/profiles/leon-bergen.html">Dr. Leon Bergen</a> and
            <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~paturi/">Dr. Ramamohan Paturi</a>.

            My research focuses on improving Large Language Modelsâ€™ (LLMs) task-solving capabilities through the lens of information retrieval (IR), extraction (IE), and utilization. 
            I study how LLMs can better process and utilize information at inference time, especially when relevant evidence is scattered across long contexts and exhibits complex interdependencies.

            I am currently working on long-context modeling for LLM agents.
