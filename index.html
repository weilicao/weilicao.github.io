        I am a third-year undergrad at UC San Diego, double majoring in Data Science 
        at the <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/">Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute</a> and 
        Mathematics-Computer Science at the <a href="https://math.ucsd.edu/">Department of Mathematics</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My research focuses on natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and
        the broader fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
        I have the privilege to work at the <a href="https://lei.ucsd.edu/">Laboratory for Emerging Intelligence</a>,
        where I'm advised by <a href="https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/profiles/leon-bergen.html">Dr. Leon Bergen</a> and
        <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~paturi/">Dr. Ramamohan Paturi</a>.<br>
