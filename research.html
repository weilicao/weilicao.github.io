    <p>
      My previous research involved evaluating LLMs' performance on aggregating information from biomedical reports.<br>
      I also worked on a project that trained a state space model (Mamba-2 130M & 1.3B) to efficiently retrieve information from long documents for question answering tasks.

    <ul>
      <li>State space models for long-context processing</li>
      <li>Retrieval-augmented language models</li>
      <li>NLP for biomedical applications</li>
      <li>Evaluation benchmarks for language models</li>
